 1. `exercise-000.rb`: This reads a file by lines and writes it out to the
    screen.
 1. `exercise-001.rb`: This prints each word in a file on a separate line.
 1. `exercise-002.rb`: This normalizes each word so that it's easier to work
    with.
 1. `exercise-003.rb`: This counts how often each word occurs in the text and
    prints those frequencies out.
 1. `exercise-004.rb`: This cleans up a small issue in the tokenization.
 1. `exercise-005.rb`: This sorts the frequency output.
 1. `exercise-006.rb`: This writes the output to a file.
 1. `exercise-007.rb`: Refactor and reuse, part 1: functions.
 1. `exercise-008.rb`: Refactor and reuse, part 2: classes.
